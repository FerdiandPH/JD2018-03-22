        <BookDescription>Java has changed dramatically since the previous edition
            of Effective Java was published shortly after the release of Java 6.
            This Jolt award-winning classic has now been thoroughly updated to take
            full advantage of the latest language and library features. The support
            in modern Java for multiple paradigms increases the need for
            specific best-practices advice, and this book delivers.</BookDescription>
